# Mandelbrot
Creating a **Mandelbrot** set Image in the Webbrowser and as a PNG using **Haskell**.

The **Local server** which hosts the Display enables a zoom function which zooms into the **generated Simulation** and creates and stores a PNG File from the zoom.

You can view the documentation [here](https://JakubSchwenkbeck.github.io/Mandelbrot/haddock/index.html).
